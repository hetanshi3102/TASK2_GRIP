# Prediction Using Unsupervised ML

This repository contains code for predicting clusters in the Iris dataset using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The code utilizes the KMeans algorithm for clustering and visualizes the results.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

````

## Code

The code is organized as follows:

1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Loading the dataset using seaborn.
3. Visualizing the effect of different parameters on the species.
4. Applying the elbow technique to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. Performing clustering using the KMeans algorithm.
6. Saving the resulting dataset and generating a confusion matrix.
7. Conclusion.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

2. Install the required libraries as mentioned in the Getting Started section.

3. Run the code:

```bash
python code.py
```

## Results

The code produces the following results:

- Scatter plots visualizing the effect of different parameters on the species.
- Elbow curve to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Cluster assignments for each data point in the dataset.
- Confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the clustering.

## Conclusion

This code successfully applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict clusters in the Iris dataset. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow technique, and the KMeans algorithm is used for clustering. The resulting clusters are evaluated using a confusion matrix.
